# 📊 Operations Analytics & Investigating Metric Spikes

This project dives into operational and engagement analytics using SQL, focusing on investigating anomalies in job reviews, user activity, and email performance. It is divided into two case studies based on realistic operational datasets.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Case Study 1: Job Data Analysis**
  - Analyzes throughput, language distribution, duplicate rows, and job review patterns.
  - Dataset: `job_data.csv`

- **Case Study 2: Investigating Metric Spike**
  - Focuses on user activity metrics like engagement, retention, and email interaction.
  - Datasets: `users.csv`, `events.csv`, `email_events.csv`

- **SQL Queries**
  - Contains `.sql` files for each analysis.
  - Queries are optimized for MySQL Workbench.

- **Report**
  - `Operation_Analytics_and_Investigating_Metric_Spikes.pdf`: Final report with insights, visualizations, and methodology.
